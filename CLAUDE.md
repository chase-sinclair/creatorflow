# CLAUDE.md — CreatorFlow

> This file is the single source of truth for the CreatorFlow project. Claude Code should read this file at the start of every session. As phases are completed, this file will be updated to reflect current state and remaining work.

---

## Project Background

CreatorFlow is a public-facing web application that helps users — primarily technical and non-technical product managers, content creators, and marketing teams — design agentic workflows for social media automation. Users describe what they want to automate, and CreatorFlow guides them through a structured experience that produces a visual, interactive workflow diagram and a plain-English summary brief they can share or export.

The product is intentionally approachable. It requires no coding knowledge to use and no account to try. The AI layer is doing real multi-step reasoning under the hood, but the user experience should feel simple, fast, and satisfying.

---

## Core User Experience (Three Phases)

**1. Discover** — User lands on the site, learns what social media automation is, browses example workflows, and finds idea prompts organized by persona. This phase exists to inspire users who don't yet know what they want to build.

**2. Brainstorm** — A conversational chat interface where the user describes their idea. An AI agent asks up to 4 clarifying questions, then summarizes the idea back to the user for confirmation. Max 4 questions — never more. Questions should feel friendly and non-technical.

**3. Build** — Once the idea is confirmed, a multi-agent LangGraph pipeline generates a full workflow. The output is an interactive visual graph (React Flow) showing agents as nodes and handoffs as edges. A plain-English summary brief lives in the sidebar. Users can refine the workflow via follow-up chat, export a PDF, or share a link.

## LangGraph Pipeline

The backend runs a stateful LangGraph pipeline with the following nodes:

- **Intake Node** — Assesses idea clarity and routes to clarification or classifier
- **Clarification Node** — Generates one question at a time (max 4 rounds) to resolve platform, goal, and automation level
- **Intent Classifier Node** — Maps confirmed idea to one of four archetypes:
  - `trend_to_content` — scan trends → generate content → publish
  - `source_transform_distribute` — ingest media → transform → push to platforms
  - `monitor_engage_report` — watch mentions → respond → summarize
  - `schedule_generate_publish` — calendar-driven content generation
- **Workflow Designer Node** — Generates full workflow as structured JSON (nodes + edges schema that React Flow renders directly)
- **Explainer Node** — Produces plain-English summary brief from workflow JSON
- **Refinement Node** — Handles post-generation follow-up chat, updates workflow JSON, appends to refinement history

### Shared State Object

```python
class CreatorFlowState(TypedDict):
    raw_idea: str
    clarifying_questions: list[str]
    clarifying_answers: list[str]
    question_round: int
    workflow_archetype: str
    target_platforms: list[str]
    automation_level: str        # "full" or "human_in_loop"
    workflow_json: dict
    summary_brief: str
    refinement_history: list[dict]
```

### Workflow JSON Schema (React Flow compatible)

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "node_1",
      "type": "agent",
      "label": "Trend Scanner",
      "description": "Monitors TikTok weekly trends and identifies the top 5 by engagement",
      "tools": ["TikTok API", "Trend scoring model"],
      "inputs": ["Platform selection", "Time window"],
      "outputs": ["Ranked trend list"]
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "from": "node_1",
      "to": "node_2",
      "label": "Passes trend list"
    }
  ],
  "archetype": "trend_to_content",
  "automation_level": "full"
}
```

- `POST /api/brainstorm/respond` — Submit answer to clarifying question, receive next question or confirmation summary

### Workflow
- `POST /api/workflow/generate` — Trigger full pipeline after idea is confirmed
- `POST /api/workflow/refine` — Submit refinement message, receive updated workflow JSON
- `GET /api/workflow/{workflow_id}` — Fetch saved workflow (used by shareable links)
- `POST /api/workflow/{workflow_id}/share` — Generate shareable link token
- `GET /api/workflow/{workflow_id}/export` — Generate and return PDF export

### Content (Discover Phase)
- `GET /api/content/examples` — Returns pre-built example workflows for the gallery
- `GET /api/content/ideas` — Returns idea prompts organized by persona

## UX & Design Principles

These must be respected across all phases:

- **No account required** to try the product. Accounts are optional and deferred.
- **Max 4 clarifying questions** in the brainstorm phase. Never exceed this.
- **Plain English everywhere** — no technical jargon in user-facing copy, node descriptions, or the summary brief.
- **Layered disclosure** on the workflow graph — default view shows node names and flow only; clicking a node reveals full detail card.
- **Progress indicators** between phases so users always know where they are.
- **Transition moments** — the Brainstorm → Build transition should include a loading animation ("Designing your workflow…") that builds anticipation.
- **Responsive** — the app must work cleanly on desktop and tablet. Mobile is secondary but should not break.
- **Viral loop** — shared workflow links render a read-only view with a "Build your own" CTA that brings new users into the Discover phase.

## Build Phases

> Complete phases in order. Do not begin a phase until the previous one is fully working and tested. After each phase is complete, the human will update this file with the next phase before continuing.

---

### Phase 1 — Project Scaffold & Environment Setup ✅ COMPLETE

**What was built:**
- Vite + React frontend with react-router-dom, tailwindcss, framer-motion, reactflow, axios
- Dark violet brand palette via CSS variables in `index.css`; Tailwind v4 with `@tailwindcss/vite`
- 4 pages + routing: `/`, `/brainstorm`, `/workflow/:workflowId`, `/share/:token`
- `Navbar` component with logo and "Start Building" CTA
- FastAPI backend with `GET /health`, placeholder routers for brainstorm/workflow/content
- `backend/agents/state.py` with full `CreatorFlowState` TypedDict
- `.env` files for both frontend and backend
- **Backend runs on port 8001** (8000 is occupied by another process on this machine)

**Run commands:**
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (port 5173)
- Backend: `cd backend && source venv/Scripts/activate && uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001`

---
### Phase 2 — Discover Page (Static) ✅ COMPLETE

**What was built:**
- `HeroSection` — animated SVG workflow preview, headline, two CTAs ("Start Building" → `/brainstorm`, "See Examples" → `#examples` anchor)
- `EducationSection` — 4 cards: what an agent is, what automation saves, workflow types, no coding needed
- `ExampleGallery` — 6 hardcoded example cards with mini SVG node diagrams, platform tags, persona tags; click logs to console
- `IdeaFuel` — persona tabs (Solo Creator / Marketing Team / Podcast Brand / Small Business), 3 prompt cards each; "Build this" navigates to `/brainstorm` with `state.prefill`
- `Footer` — logo, tagline, link to brainstorm
- All data hardcoded in `frontend/src/lib/constants.js`
- Framer Motion scroll-triggered animations on all sections (`useInView`)
- `html { scroll-behavior: smooth }` for anchor scrolling
- Page title + meta description set in `index.html`
---

## Current Status

**Active Phase:** Phase 3 — Backend Core: LangGraph Pipeline

**Completed Phases:** Phase 1, Phase 2

## Notes for Claude Code

- Always read this file at the start of a session before taking any action
- Never skip ahead to a later phase — complete and verify acceptance criteria before moving on
- When in doubt about a design decision not covered here, default to the simpler, more user-friendly option
- All Claude API calls use model `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` and `max_tokens: 1000` unless a specific node requires longer output (designer and explainer nodes may need up to 2000)
- Keep prompts in `backend/prompts/` clean and well-commented — they are part of the portfolio artifact
- Commit frequently with descriptive commit messages
